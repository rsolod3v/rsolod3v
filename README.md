### 🎮 Hey, I'm RsoloD3v

I'm an indie developer who loves creating 2D games with **GameMaker**.  
I focus on atmosphere, small details, and giving each project its own soul — even the unfinished ones.  

💡 **What I enjoy:**  
- Pixel art, simple mechanics, and weird ideas that just *work*  
- Designing systems that feel alive  
- Mixing music and code until it feels like magic  

🧰 **Tools I use:**  
`GameMaker Studio 2` • `Aseprite` • `Patience (sometimes)`

🎧 I make games the same way I listen to music — by feeling, not formula.
